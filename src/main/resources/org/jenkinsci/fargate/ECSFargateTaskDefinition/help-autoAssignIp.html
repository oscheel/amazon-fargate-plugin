    Container instances need external network access to communicate with the Amazon ECS service endpoint, so if your container instances do not have public IP addresses, then they must use network address translation (NAT) to provide this access. For more information, see NAT Gateways in the Amazon VPC User Guide and HTTP Proxy Configuration in this guide. For more information, see Tutorial: Creating a VPC with Public and Private Subnets for Your Clusters
